in the Streets</p>

<p>This is the house in which JOHANN SEBASTIAN
BACH was born.</p>

<span class="caption">THE HOUSE IN WHICH BACH WAS BORN.</span>
</div>

<p>This house stands in the town of Eisenach in
Germany. It looks very much the same today as it
did when Sebastian was a little boy. Many people
go there to visit this house because the little boy
grew to be a famous man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;4]</span>
In Eisenach there is a statue of Bach near the
palace.</p>

<p>In the same town in which Sebastian was born
there stands on the top of a hill a very famous castle
built many hundreds of years ago.</p>

<p>This castle is called the Wartburg.</p>

<span class="caption">THE CASTLE AT WARTBURG.</span>

<p>As a boy little Sebastian used to climb the hill with
his friends, and they, no doubt, had a happy time playing
about the castle grounds. In one of its great halls
the minstrels of Germany held their Song Contests.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;5]</span>
When Sebastian was old enough he used to
travel afoot, just as the minstrels did; his purpose
was to go to hear fine organ players. Once as he
sat weary by the roadside someone threw a herring
to him so that he might eat as he rested.</p>

<p>Little Sebastian's father was named JOHANN
AMBROSIUS BACH. He, too, was a musician, as
his people had been for many years.</p>

One of these was a miller who played and sang
while the corn was grinding. His name was Veit
Bach, and his little boy was called Hans, the Player,
because he, too, loved to play the violin.</p>

<p>When Sebastian was ten years old his father
and mother died. So he went to live with his brother,
whose home was a few miles away.</p>

<p>Of this brother Sebastian had music lessons, and
he improved so rapidly that he used to beg to be allowed
to play the pieces in a big book in the library.</p>

<p>But the brother refused him this pleasure. However,
little Sebastian was eager to learn all the music
he could find, so he used to sit up on moonlight nights
and copy these pages while his brother was asleep.</p>

<p>But what do you think happened when he had
copied everything in that big book?</p>

<p>His brother found out what he had done and
took all his precious music away from him.</p>

<p>If you know any boy who is about twenty years
old you may say to him, Bach was as old as you are
when Benjamin Franklin was born in Boston.</p>

<p>And although there was this difference of twenty
years or so in their ages, we may think of them at
work in the world at the same time. You must remember
that all men like Franklin and Bach who
became famous did so by working very hard.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/illus09.jpg"  alt="BENJAMIN FRANKLIN." title="BENJAMIN FRANKLIN." /><br />
<span class="caption">BENJAMIN FRANKLIN.</span>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;8]</span>
Franklin, too, was born very poor. Once he
walked the streets of Philadelphia with a loaf of
bread under each arm. But by being faithful in all
he did he became the friend of all his countrymen
and of Kings and Queens besides.</p>

<p>Benjamin Franklin was quite a little younger
than Sebastian Bach. But there was a famous man
who was almost exactly Sebastian's age. This man
composed an Oratorio that is loved by everybody. It
is sung in cities and towns all over the world, particularly
at Christmas time.</p>

<p>Do you happen to know the name of this Oratorio?
If not, you can surely learn it by asking someone
or by looking it up in a book.</p>

<p>Write in the name of the composer of this
Oratorio below the picture, and write on this line the
name of the Oratorio itself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;9]</span>
The Oratorio, the name of which you have just
written, was first sung in the Irish city of Dublin, 1742.</p>

<p>At that time Sebastian Bach was living in Leipsic
and had been for many years at the head of the
Thomas School. He was known as its Cantor. Bach
worked very hard here to supply music for several of
the Leipsic churches, and he worked so well that his
fame spread until it reached the ears of the Emperor.</p>

<p>Frederick the Great was also a musician and
composer. So he invited Sebastian Bach to visit him
at his castle. There were many people present, but
Sebastian Bach was the principal guest. He played
on many of the Emperor's fine pianos. When he
reached home again he composed a musical work
and dedicated it to the Emperor.</p>

The kind of a piano that Sebastian Bach played
on was not called a piano in his day. It was called
a Clavier or Clavichord.</p>

<p>Some day you will study a collection of pieces by
Sebastian Bach which was written for this instrument
and was called <i>The Well Tempered Clavichord</i>.</p>

<p>This is the kind of piano, or clavichord, that
Bach used.</p>

<p>Sebastian Bach had a very large family, twenty
children altogether. Two of them studied music
faithfully with their father.</p>

<p>One was Friedmann, for whom the father
wrote a book called <i>Little Preludes</i>. Friedmann's
brother, Philipp Emanuel Bach, was a very fine
clavichord player. He wrote a book about music
and composed many pieces.</p>

Sebastian Bach died in 1750. He was sixty-five
years of age.</p>

<p>Benjamin Franklin was at that time forty-four
years old and George Washington was eighteen.</p>

<p>This is the way Bach wrote his name.</p>
